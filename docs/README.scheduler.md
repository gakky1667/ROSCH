Required ROS node information:
  
 * __nodename__ : the name of ROS node
 * __core__ : if this node uses n cores, core is n.
 * __sub_topic__ : topic for subscribe
 * __pub_topic__ : topic for publish
 * __run_time__ : the execution time
 * __deadline__ : if not the end node, this value is 0
 * __sched_info__ : scheduling parameters (i.g., `core`, `priority`, `start_time`, `run_time`). Note that `core` at sched_info indicates tha place to assign ROS node.
