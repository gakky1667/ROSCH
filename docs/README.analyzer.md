Analyzer dipicts a graph and a scheduling result. Note that Analyzer refers to $(TOPDIR)/analyzer_rosch.yaml Pleas, change it.

Required ROS node information:

 * __core__ : if this node uses n cores, core is n.
 * __sub_topic__ : topic for subscribe
 * __pub_topic__ : topic for publish
 * __run_time__ : the execution time
 * __deadline__ : if not the end node, this value is 0

```sh 
$ cd $(TOPDIR)/Analyzer/bin
$ ./Analyzer
```
